The more you complicate a solution, the more specific it becomes to the problem being solved. The less you assume, the more you generalize. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this article specific to Machine Learning and how simple things can do wonders!
Language There is something magical about how a little child learns a language. The child is not imparted any knowledge related to the semantics or the grammar of the language.</description></item><item><title/><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 18:07:07 +0530</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UC San Diego jointly advised by Professor Julian McAuley and Professor Shlomo Dubnov. I am currently working on machine learning for audio signal processing and also exploring vulnerabilities in neural network based sequence models. I received my undergraduate (B. Tech) degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee in 2017.
Besides my research, I lead the software engineering team at Blue Water Trade Winds.</description></item></channel></rss>
