      <description>The road was misty, dull and dark,
No one was there to lift my heart.
I&amp;rsquo;m all alone in that scary way,
The road less travelled is what they say.
Was I too brave to take a try?
On the road less travelled by.
Was I too strong to face the rocks?
I want a chance to turn the clocks.
If the choice was wrong, you make it right,</description>

      <title>Step Aside From The Race</title>

      <description>This is one of my first poems and my personal favourite. 
Step aside from the race to think.
Relax and realize the purpose of the race
Think from an unconditioned perspective
Are we here to survive?
Why are we so desperate to keep the world moving?
Are we merely players in The Big Drama?
Being watched by an unknown audience
And we humans playing the role of fools and jokers</description>
