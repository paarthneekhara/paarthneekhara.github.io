      <title>Lift Your Heart</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The road was misty, dull and dark,&lt;br /&gt;
No one was there to lift my heart.&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m all alone in that scary way,&lt;br /&gt;
The road less travelled is what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was I too brave to take a try?&lt;br /&gt;
On the road less travelled by.&lt;br /&gt;
Was I too strong to face the rocks?&lt;br /&gt;
I want a chance to turn the clocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the choice was wrong, you make it right,&lt;br /&gt;
Face the rocks be brave and fight.&lt;br /&gt;
You know you can, you know you will,&lt;br /&gt;
Lift your heart, you can&amp;rsquo;t stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were sane when you went ahead,&lt;br /&gt;
You had a thought, believe in that.&lt;br /&gt;
The thought was deep but wasn&amp;rsquo;t hollow,&lt;br /&gt;
Make the road for others to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Step Aside From The Race</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-is-one-of-my-first-poems-and-my-personal-favourite&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is one of my first poems and my personal favourite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Step aside from the race to think.&lt;br /&gt;
Relax and realize the purpose of the race&lt;br /&gt;
Think from an unconditioned perspective&lt;br /&gt;
Are we here to survive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are we so desperate to keep the world moving?&lt;br /&gt;
Are we merely players in The Big Drama?&lt;br /&gt;
Being watched by an unknown audience&lt;br /&gt;
And we humans playing the role of fools and jokers&lt;br /&gt;
In the more sensible world around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this life a gift or a trap?&lt;br /&gt;
With luxuries merely the baits,&lt;br /&gt;
To catch the innocent beings&lt;br /&gt;
In this illusionary and deceiving world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think again before you rejoin the race&lt;br /&gt;
Itâ€™s destination unknown but it&amp;rsquo;s end assured&lt;br /&gt;
I rejoin the &amp;lsquo;Race&amp;rsquo; once more&lt;br /&gt;
Would think about it another day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
