      <description>I remember these words from a lecture on Theory of Computation. The more you complicate a solution, the more specific it becomes to the problem being solved. The less you assume, the more you generalize. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this article specific to Machine Learning and how simple things can do wonders!
Language There is something magical about how a little child learns a language. The child is not imparted any knowledge related to the semantics or the grammar of the language.</description>

      <description>As I step into a new chapter of life, I recollect my fondest of memories in the Himalyas. It is hard to recall when I first discovered my love for the mountains. Maybe it was my first trek in the school days when I felt very proud about completing. Or it was when I had my first camera and wanted to visit places that would make __ pictures. I dont know, but I am sure anyone who has experieced the hills would find it hard to not fall in love with them.</description>
