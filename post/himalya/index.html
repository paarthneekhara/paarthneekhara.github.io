It is hard to recall when I first discovered my love for the mountains. Maybe it was my first trek in the school days when I felt very proud about completing. Or it was when I had my first camera and wanted to visit places that would make __ pictures. I dont know, but I am sure anyone who has experieced the hills would find it hard to not fall in love with them.</p><p><img src=/blogs/himalyas/13.jpg style=width:100%></p><p>A trip to the hills has always been way different than others. A Himalyan trek is not just about a few days and nights of hiking and camping. It includes weeks of excitement before the trek and life lasting memories after the trip. It is hard to pen down the multitude of emotions I go through during a trek. The anxiety at the basecamp about the trek ahead. Feeling elated about being with people you love at a place which is nothing less than heaven. The relief at the summit about not giving up halfway. The realisation that the High will not last forever and you will rejoin regular life in a few days.</p><p>Treks are not a cake walk through a dreamy landscape. They are not supposed to be easy and predictable.
There have been times when my legs were too tired to move and I was gasping for breath.</p><blockquote><p><strong>I&rsquo;ve had those moments when I just lied down asking myself &ldquo;Why am I doing this?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s hard to convincingly answer that. However, it&rsquo;s equally hard to reason whatever it is that I am doing in life.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The strange thing is, despite everything that might have gone wrong on the trek, the only question that pops up after it&rsquo;s over is <strong><em>&ldquo;When am I doing this again?&rdquo;</em></strong>.</p><p><img src=/blogs/himalyas/11.jpg class=full_width_image></p><p>A few years back, I don&rsquo;t know why, but I got all crazy and desperate to go on a solo trip to Ladakh. No doubt I was super excited about it, but among all the Himalyan trips, that&rsquo;s the one I am able recollect the least. I realised that I can be in the most amazing place on earth and capture it in my camera, but that&rsquo;s not enough find a spot among my sweet memories. I am able to repaint other trips in my mind not by the pictures I clicked, but by the mid-night stories we shared in the camps, the nicknames we made during the trek, the philosophical rants and all the little laughs we had. Amongst all the travel quotes, nothing resonates more than the last one from Into the Wild &ldquo;Happiness is only real when shared&rdquo;.</p><p><img src=/blogs/himalyas/5.jpg style=width:100%></p><p>Talking about Happiness, Himalyas have taught me how affordable it really is. One of my favourite trips is that of the Valley Of Flowers and Hemkund Sahib. We rented rooms as cheap as Rs 100 per person per night, had our meals at Gurudwaras and probably had the best time of our lives. Our per day expenses were less than that of a PVR movie ticket, and we were treated with landscapes like below, all day long, in 3D!</p><p><img src=/blogs/himalyas/4.jpg class=full_width_image></p><p>One of the hardest things to negotiate during a the final few hours of a tough ascent is whether to carry on or turn back. Giving up just a few hundred meters below the summit sounds insane, however, at that moment, turning back might seem the most sensible thing to do rather than punishing your body. It&rsquo;s a very personal choice which is guided by your desire to conquer the mountain. In group of 7-8 people, there have been very few times when all of us made it to the summit. While you might not be very excited about the view from the top, however if you choose to give up, it gets hard to justify the amount of effort you put in to reach where you are.</p><p><img src=/blogs/himalyas/15.jpg class=full_width_image>
Another constant among all the Himalyan expeditions have been the emotions on the last day of the trip. No matter how much I enjoyed my time in the Himalyas, they don&rsquo;t hold me back. I always get this strong urge to get home quick and safe. I remember this incident when my foot lost grip on an icy slope and I slipped down a couple of meters on my butt before my hands gained enough friction to stop. It&rsquo;s funny how much those few seconds of fear can teach you. At that time, all I wanted to see was the smile on my parents&rsquo; face when I get back home.</p><p>The Himalyas have taught me that how affordable happiness really is.

A cinema ticket in the PVR would cost more than that, and still not</p><p><img src=/blogs/himalyas/4.jpg class=full_width_image></p><p>Whenever I come across a remote settlement in the hills, it is
I come across many remote settlements amongst the vastness of the Himalyas. The picture looks so dreamy, a small hut right across a river with snow capped peaks all around it. I am always caught up in to schools of thought. One is can it ever get boring living in such a place? Will the hills be any less thrilling given you watch them each day. What brought the people there.
